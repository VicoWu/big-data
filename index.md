## Presto Spill to Disk Deep Dive

By default, Presto kills queries if the memory requested by the query execution exceeds session properties `query_max_memory` or `query_max_memory_per_node`. This mechanism ensures fairness in allocation of memory to queries and prevents deadlock caused by memory allocation. It is efficient when there is a lot of small queries in the cluster, but leads to killing large queries that donâ€™t stay within the limits.

To overcome this inefficiency, the concept of revocable memory was introduced. A query can request memory that does not count toward the limits, but this memory can be revoked by the memory manager at any time. When memory is revoked, the query runner spills intermediate data from memory to disk and continues to process it later.
